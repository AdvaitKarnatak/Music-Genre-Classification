# Music-Genre-Classification

In the project, I first started with basic data loading, feature extraction(as in MFCCs) and EDA. For the training part, I trained the data over different models, starting from a basic ANN model. Then I moved on to applying CNNs to Mel Spectograms to achieve a higher accuracy and then finally moved to a RNN-LSTM model. Having a limited dataset from GTZAN of 10k samples, I utilised strong data augmentation techniques using Librosa, Audiomentations and NumPy, to enhance the model's robustness. Finally, I tried a CNN-RNN hybrid model which first read the features using CNN layers and then understood the feature progression using LSTM layers. Different DL techniques and concepts like hyperparameter tuning, regularization, early stopping, masking(dropout) etc were utilised throughout.
